# Introduction

This exercise will be focussed on the Liskov Substitution Principle:
- Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

# Exercise 4

- Examine the design of the Student and its derived classes and try to identify how introducing this new "Unlimited" student type would break LSP.
